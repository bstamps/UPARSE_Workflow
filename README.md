USEARCH_Workflow
================

A shell script I use to process raw Illumina amplicon sequencing data through UPARSE and QIIME.
This is more of a way for me to keep my workflow consistant between analyses- if you find this, I can't offer any support at the moment.

NOTE: The script has a static release 25-Feb-2015 for an upcoming publication.
